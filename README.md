# Battleship

   Welcome to Battleship!
   
In this project you will build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship!
In this version of the game, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid.
The player will have 4 guesses to try to sink the ship.

To build this game you should have knowledge of lists, conditionals and functions in Python.
